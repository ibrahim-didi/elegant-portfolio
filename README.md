```
node@v18.0.0 or higher
git@2.33.0 or higher
```

If you intend to develop and deploy with Gatsby (recommended), you will need to install the Gatsby CLI as well:

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

1.  **Clone the repository**

    Clone this repository.

    ```bash

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd my-site/
    npm i --lockfile-version 2
    ```

    Start up your site.
